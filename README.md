# 1020-traffic-simulation

Hey there! 

This is a code for a traffic sumulation program I developed for a school project using an arduino grove shield.
Using a module provided for the arduino functions, i developed this program to work with various input and output components such as:
-Touch sensor
-Button
-LEDs and LED sockets
-Servo Motor

I have a demo video on my portfolio website, feel free to check it out!
